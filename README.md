# TI1_PANTOJA_CARLOS

_This repository contains a Java project made in Eclipse which is a platform for registering and updating restaurant orders._

## Starting üöÄ

_To obtain a copy of the project, you only need to download it_

### Prerequisites üìã

_You must have a current version of Java installed, JDK 1.8 and a current version of Eclipse_

## Running the tests ‚öôÔ∏è

_To run the tests of this system, just run the JUnit Test from the Eclipse Run_

## Version üìå

_This is the second version of this project, a rubric was used from which the following aspects were improved:_

Git:
* "In the repository there is an eclipse project, with the bin, src, test, data and docs directories" In docs there is 1 document with the functional requirements, in the same document the images of the class diagram design in high resolution (not blurred) and test format. In the same docs directory is the api directory with the generated javadoc. "
* "The student user has at least 10 commits with at least 1 hour difference between them in the remote repository (GitHub or GitLab) (1.5 if it has 1 commit, 3.0 if it has 2 commits, 5.0 if it has all 3 commits) "

Class diagram:
* The class diagram of the model respects the UML syntax, the classes (their attributes, constants and methods) are well defined, the established relationships are appropriate and have the correct direction and form according to their type (the relationships of association have correct cardinality and name). Define each package appropriately.
* Correctly define at least 2 classes of exceptions indicating that they inherit from Exception (the stereotype <<Exception>> must be used)
* Define the classes of the unit tests for each class in the model
* The class diagram includes correctly defined classes, methods, attributes and constants of the model, satisfying the needs stated in the statement.
* The UI design must have at least 1 Menu class with different methods for each responsibility, in addition to the Main class where there is only the main method that invokes the main method of the menu.

Implementation:
* The program allows the registration and updating of restaurants, products and customers
* The program allows the registration of orders and subsequent updating of their status
* "The program allows you to generate the following two reports on the screen:
* All restaurants in ascending alphabetical order
* All customers in order of their descending phone number
* The program has an option that does binary search for a customer given a name and indicates the time that the search took. Clients are inserted in that order always to keep the list ordered.
* The program implements at least 2 ordering algorithms of the 3 seen in class (bubble, selection and insertion). It does at least 1 sort using Comparable and 1 sort using Comparator, both using the Collections or Arrays sort.
* The program allows you to import data from a csv file with information on 1) restaurants, another with information on 2) customers, another with information on 3) products and another with information on 4) orders. The project has in the data directory each csv file with at least 1000 data each
* Correct implementation of the UI, respecting the design which must have at least 1 Menu class with different methods for each responsibility.
* At least 2 own exceptions are thrown in the program and their handling is as suggested: they are thrown in the model and caught in the ui
* "Correct and complete implementation of the tests, according to the design. The tests are carried out properly and run without problems (all in green). Implement at least 2 tests for each class of the model."
* The program works correctly. HAS NO WARNINGS. It can be executed and the functionalities can be used as described in the statement
